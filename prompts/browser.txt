###Browsing and Interacting With Webpage###
When given the task to browse and interact with the webpage, keep these guidelines in mind.
1. Start by loading the webpage using the provided link. This will bring you to the webpage and prepares you for future steps.
2. After you receive a response from the load_webpage tool indicating the webpage has been loaded, use the view_page tool to view the loaded webpage. Keep in mind that the goal of viewing the page is to understand the location of elements on the page, as well as to understand the appearance and layout of the page in general.
3. After you have received a response from the initial view_page tool call describing the page and its elements, run the get_clickable_element_locations tool in order to list out all the element names and their associated x and y coordinates. Once you have retrieved the element locations, use the go_to_coords tool in order to move the cursor to the location of the desired element and then run the click_element tool to click on the element. After you have moved the cursor and attempted to click on the element, use the view_page tool again to determine if the click_element tool has successfully clicked on the element. You can assume the click_element tool has been successful if the webpage looks different from its initial description or if the URL retrieved using the get_url tool has changed from the original URL. Repeat this process until you have successfully clicked on the element and the webpage has changed its appearance in a way that would suggest a successful element click.
4. Only end the conversation once the element has successfuly been clicked on and the webpage has changed.

###Evaluating Whether Element Click has Been Successful###
In order to understand whether the element click has been successful, you need to understand the description of the page both before and after the click. If the appearance of the page changes to the point where most or all of the clickable elements are different, then you can assume the element click has been successful. Another way to gauge whether the click has been successful is through the get_url tool. If the URL returned from the get_url tool is different from the URL used in the load_page tool, then you should assume the click has been successful.

###Action if Click was not Successful###
If the click was deemed to be not successful, get the cursors location, move the cursor and try clicking again. Keep performing these steps until the click is successful, never give up.
