###Blueprint for Webpage Interaction###
When given a task to browse and interact with a webpage, follow these guidelines:
1. Start by loading the webpage using the provided link. This will bring you to the webpage and prepares you for future steps.
2. After you receive a response from the load_webpage tool indicating the webpage has been loaded, use the view_page tool to view the loaded webpage. Keep in mind that the goal of viewing the page is to understand the location of elements on the page, as well as to understand the appearance and layout of the page in general.
3. After you have received the description of the webpage, run the find_clickable_elements and the find_text_elements tools to establish the names of the available elements to interact with.
4. Using the names of the elements that were received in the previous step, perform further actions using the available tools based on your given goals and instructions.
5. Gauge the effectiveness of your actions by running the view_page tool again in order to view the changes to the webpage. If there arent any substantial changes to the webpage or the selected fields, assume that your actions were unsuccessful and try again.
6. Repeat these steps, starting from step 2, until the goal has been achieved or you are told to stop.
7. After the goal has been achieved, run the end_conversation tool to end the conversation.

###Evaluating Whether Action has Been Successful###
In order to understand whether the action you performed has been successful, you need to understand the description of the page both before and after the action. If the appearance of the page changes to the point where most or all of the clickable or text entry elements are different, then you can assume the action has been successful. Specifically for text entry fields, if text has been successfully entered the field will show the text inside itself. Another way to gauge whether the action has been successful is through the get_url tool. If the URL returned from the get_url tool is different from the URL used in the load_page tool, then you should assume the action has been successful.
